# sloth

A little tool to help out prevent idling the (windows) pc. Made this tool to overrule company-administered screen-timeouts, but what you use it for is up to you. Not saying it could be helpful for homeoffice and beeing "online" all the time.

How it works: if the application is running and the screen is not locked, every minute an idle-timer checks the current idle status. If the machine is idle for more than 3 minutes, the "shift"-key is pressed, thus ending the idle period.
